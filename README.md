# Flight_Assistant
A Windows Form Application that utilizes a MySQL database for obtaining and storing flight information. There is five database tables: Flights, Airline, Arrive, Departs, and Airport. They have important relationships to each other and embody normalization concepts. The application itself creates queries based on the specific criteria the user enters. This project was created by a partner and myself for my Applied Database Systems (COP4703) elective course. Tools Used: C#/.NET (including MySqlClient Frameworks), SQL, MySQL Workbench, Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
